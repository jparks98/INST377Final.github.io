### Information Problem
The information problem is that the residents of College Park/Prince George’s County may not know about polling places where they can practice their civic right to vote. This could be due to the information not being readily available or difficulty when navigating through the information.
### Our Stakeholders
Any Prince George's County resident that is of voting age or will be of voting age by the Maryland Primary Election or the United States General Election is a stakeholder for our project. The government of Prince George's County will also be a stakeholder as we hope they see our project will be an improvement on their current map.

### Chosen Strategies and Solutions

### Techincal System Decision Rational

### Did We Address Our Problem?
Our original problem statement was addressed with our application. The problem looked to address voter turnout was so low. We came to the conclusion that the low voter could be due to a lack of information. We wanted our application to solve that information shortage.  We accomplished this task by giving a user a map of every polling location in PG county and providing with a list that the location’s name. There is even te feature to provide diections to the user through Gogle. We believe these solves the problem of of oters haing enough information about their oclal polling stations.

### Challenges Faced and Their Impact

### Future Plans
There are a couple of features we would like in the future. The first would be to incorporate facets to filter the results for each user. This feature would allow the uses to eliminate certain polling stations that do not fit their criteria. The second feature is to add a form where users can enter their address and the website will show them all polling locations within a specified mileage radius to their address. By eliminating non-feasible polling stations we minimize how much information the user sees and avoid the risk of information overload. Finally, we would like to create a plugin that adds information about a selected marker or location from the list to the sidebar of the website. this would the user to compare the information of different polling places and make the most informed decision they can.
